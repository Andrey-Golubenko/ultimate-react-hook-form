## About the absolute imports

To correctly functioning (code and tests) of absolute imports, you should add some codes in some files, like:

- jest.config.js
- vite.config.ts
- tsconfig.json

We already writed some absolute imports on these files, so if you wanna more paths or edit some, feel free to do.
If your not safe about it or have some question, send us a thread on [Github Discussions](https://github.com/potreco/viterc/discussions/new?category=q-a) asking for, we were happy to help
